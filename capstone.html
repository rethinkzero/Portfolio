        <h3 class="interview-heading">Interview Notes - Participant 1: Maria, 28, Graphic Designer</h3>
        <p class="research-text">
          <strong>Motivation:</strong> "I try to bike or take the train, but sometimes I need a car. I always feel guilty opening a standard rideshare app because of the emissions."
        </p>
        <p class="research-text">
          <strong>Frustrations:</strong> "The 'green' option in other apps is always more expensive and sometimes the car that shows up isn't even a hybrid. It feels like a scam. The apps are also cluttered with too many options I don't need."
        </p>
        <p class="research-text">
          <strong>Needs:</strong> "I want an app that is simple, confirms my ride is truly zero-emission, and maybe even shows me the carbon savings. I'd pay a small premium for that peace of mind."

        </p>
        <p class="research-text">
          <strong>Frustrations:</strong> "Most ride-booking interfaces are designed for speed and cost, not impact. I have to dig through menus to find the sustainable choice, if it exists at all."
        </p>
        <p class="research-text">
          <strong>Needs:</strong> "Transparency is key. Where are the cars charged? What is the company's broader environmental policy? The app experience should feel clean and efficient, just like the vehicles."

      <div class="platform-info-grid">
        <div class="insight-item">
          <h4>Trust through Transparency</h4>
          <p>
            The audience is skeptical of "greenwashing." They demand verifiable proof of environmental impact (e.g., carbon savings tracker, details on vehicle sourcing and charging).
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-item">
          <h4>Simplicity as a Value</h4>
          <p>
            Users are frustrated with cluttered, complex apps. A clean, intuitive, and fast interface is not just a preference but is intrinsically linked to the brand's promise of "green" efficiency.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-item">
          <h4>Guilt-Free Convenience</h4>
          <p>
            The primary emotional driver is the desire to make a convenient choice without environmental guilt. The service alleviates the cognitive dissonance between needing a quick ride and wanting to be sustainable.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-item">
          <h4>Value-Based Alignment</h4>
          <p>
            Users see choosing GreenWheels as an extension of their personal identity and values, not just a transaction.

      <p class="research-text">
        This research directly informs our campaign to be built on the pillars of Clarity, Trust, and Impact. We will prioritize a minimalist UI that makes booking a green ride the default, easiest path. Furthermore, we will integrate features like a "Carbon Savings Profile" and clear information on our fleet's sustainability to build trust and speak directly to our audience's values, turning a simple app into a statement.
