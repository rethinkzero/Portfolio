          <div class="interview-content">
            <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> "I try to bike or take the train, but sometimes I need a car. I always feel guilty opening a standard rideshare app because of the emissions."</p>
            <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> "The 'green' option in other apps is always more expensive, and sometimes the car that shows up isn't even a hybrid. It feels like a scam. The apps are also cluttered with too many options I don't need."</p>
            <p><strong>Needs:</strong> "I want a simple app, confirms my ride is truly zero-emission, and maybe even shows me the carbon savings. I'd pay a small premium for that peace of mind."</p>

            <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> "My purchasing decisions are a vote for the kind of world I want to live in. I choose brands that align with my values."</p>
            <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> "Most ride-booking interfaces are designed for speed and cost, not impact. I have to dig through menus to find the sustainable choice, if it exists at all."</p>
            <p><strong>Needs:</strong> "Transparency is key. Where are the cars charged? What is the company's broader environmental policy? The app experience should feel clean and efficient, just like the vehicles."</p>
