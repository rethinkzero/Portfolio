- How the Algorithm Works:  The TikTok algorithm is designed to maximize user watch time. It tests every new video on a small audience first. If those users watch it all the way through and engage with it, the algorithm identifies the video as a "success." It then pushes that video to larger and larger audiences in waves, repeating the process. The system ranks videos for your "For You" page based heavily on your own interactions (like what you watch completely and like) and a video's overall performance. It constantly learns and adapts to your changing tastes while occasionally throwing in something new to avoid a repetitive feed.
